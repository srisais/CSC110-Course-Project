Module Description
==================
This file is the <main> module for the project. Running this file should
be enough to run the program. This file will import from other modules,
so ensure that the requirements have been satisfied (see <requirements.txt>).

This project is meant to view the course enrollment data for
Ontario High Schools and use a polynomial regression to try and
predict what the course enrollment might have been,
if the COVID-19 pandemic did not occur, based on the previous years' data.
